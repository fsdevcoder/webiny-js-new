### Installation

`yarn add webiny-data-extractor`


### Get started

Data extractor support several ways to extract data, which are demonstrated in the following examples.

#### Sample data

    const data = {
    	"firstName": "John",
    	"lastName": "Doe",
    	"age": 30,
    	"enabled": true,
    	"company": {
    		"name": "Webiny LTD",
    		"city": "London"
    	},
    	"subscription": {
    		"name": "Free",
    		"price": 0,
    		"commitment": {
    			"expiresOn": "never",
    			"startedOn": 2018,
    			"enabled": true
    		}
    	},
    	"simpleCollection": [
    		{id: 1, name: "one"},
    		{id: 2, name: "two"},
    		{id: 3, name: "three"},
    		{id: 4, name: "four"}
    	],
    	promised: new Promise(resolve => {
    		setTimeout(() => {
    			resolve(100);
    		}, 5);
    	})
    };

#### Simple extraction

    const extractor = require("webiny-data-extractor");
    await extractor.get(data, "firstName,lastName,age,company");

This will return the following result:

    {
        "firstName": "John",
        "lastName": "Doe",
        "age": 30,
        "company": {
            "name": "Webiny LTD",
            "city": "London"
        }
    }

Notice how the company was returned completely with all nested keys. But we can also return only specific nested keys.

#### Nested keys with dot notation

    const extractor = require("webiny-data-extractor");
    await extractor.get(data, "firstName,lastName,age,company.city");

This will return the following result:

    {
        "firstName": "John",
        "lastName": "Doe",
        "age": 30,
        "company": {
            "city": "London"
        }
    }

Another example:

    const extractor = require("webiny-data-extractor");
    await extractor.get(data, "subscription.name,subscription.price,subscription.commitment");

This will return the following result:

    {
        "subscription": {
            "name": "Free",
            "price": 0,
            "commitment": {
                "expiresOn": "never",
                "startedOn": 2018,
                "enabled": true
            }
        }
    }

#### Nested keys with square brackets notation

From the previous example, listing keys using `subscription.name,subscription.price,subscription.commitment` can become tiring. Alternatively,
square brackets can be used.

    const extractor = require("webiny-data-extractor");
    await extractor.get(data, "subscription[name,price,commitment]");

This will return the same as in previous example.

More advanced example:

    const extractor = require("webiny-data-extractor");
    await extractor.get(data, "age,subscription[name,price,commitment[expiresOn,enabled]]");

This will return the following result:

    {
        "age": 30,
        "subscription": {
            "name": "Free",
            "price": 0,
            "commitment": {
                "expiresOn": "never",
                "enabled": true
            }
        }
    }

#### Multi-line supported

When having many keys to extract, keys can be specified over multiple lines by using [template literals](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals). 
This way the code becomes more readable by not having to specify all keys in one line.

    const extractor = require("webiny-data-extractor");
    await extractor.get(data, `
        firstName,lastName,age,enabled,
        subscription[name,price,commitment],
        simpleCollection[id,name]
    `);

#### Extracting arrays

Data extractor recognizes when a specified key is an array, in which case it will iterate and execute extraction over each item.

    const extractor = require("webiny-data-extractor");
    await extractor.get(data, "simpleCollection[name]");

This will return the following result:

    {
        simpleCollection: [
            {name: "one"},
            {name: "two"},
            {name: "three"},
            {name: "four"}
        ]
    }

#### Extracting promises

In case key in given data represents an unresolved promise, data extractor will make sure it is first resolved.

    const extractor = require("webiny-data-extractor");
    await extractor.get(data, "promised");

This will return the following result:

    {
        promised: 100
    }


### Classes

Data extractor class.

##### get

Returns extracted data.

**Parameters**

-   `data` **{}** Data object on which the extraction will be performed.
-   `keys` **[string](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)** Comma-separated keys which need to be extracted. For nested keys, dot and square brackets notation is available.
-   `options` **[ExtractionOptions](#extractionoptions)** Extraction options.

Returns **[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)&lt;{}>** 

### Flow types

The following are Flow types used in this package:


#### ExtractionOptions

[packages-utils/webiny-data-extractor/types.js:8-11](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/7b3f1af0004cb70eee55347b17a88ddcef4800b8/packages-utils/webiny-data-extractor/types.js#L8-L11 "Source code on GitHub")

All possible data extraction options.

**Properties**

-   `includeUndefined` **[boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Boolean)?** By default, if extracted value is undefined, its key will be omitted in the final output. Set to `true` if this behavior is not desired.
-   `onRead` **[Function](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/function)?** A callback function, which gets triggered when data extractor tries to read a key from given data.
