# Checkbox

A Checkbox component is commonly used inside a `<Form>` component which provides value, onChange callback, validation, etc.
You can use it outside of a `<Form>` component, but then you have to handle value changes and validation (if any) on your own.


TODO: finish this, checkbox groups missing.

## Installation
