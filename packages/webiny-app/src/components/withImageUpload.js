// Image flickering issue - once the image was uploaded, the data URL is switched with the actual path, which makes
// the image flicker.
// It is hard to know when the uploaded image was loaded in the actual image component. Sure, we have the URL to the
// image in the "onChange" callback, but the problem is that a "transform" could be applied on the Image component, which
// is represented by a different URL, which cannot be accessed here.
// In the end, we decided to just wait for a second after the upload has finished, which should
// give some time for the actual image to load, and should prevent the image flickering a bit.
