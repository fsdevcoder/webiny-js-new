# Webiny API [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Webiny/webiny-api.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Webiny/webiny-api) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/Webiny/webiny-api/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/Webiny/webiny-api?branch=master)

Express middleware to quickly build powerful REST APIs.

It provides support for running multiple apps, both 3rd party and the ones you create.
In combination with `webiny-entity` library it makes development of business applications a breeze.

We are developing this with `serverless` in mind so you will not be limited by your server (or the lack of one :)).

Integration with your existing node apps will also be seamless as long as you support the standard middleware function signature: `(req, res, next)`.
